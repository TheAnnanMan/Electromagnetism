## Key concepts

- Current is slowed by resistance
- **Unit**: Ohms, Î©
- **Symbol** : R


When there is a potential difference (a *voltage*) between two places, then charge experiences a force and begins to move as a current.
If it is difficult for the charge to move quickly (for there to be a large *current*), then we say there is high *resistance* in the material the current is trying to flow in.

The Equation that models is this relationship Ohm's Law:

*+[V = I.R](https://github.com/mixmix/nice_eqns/blob/master/physics/ohms_law.md)*
