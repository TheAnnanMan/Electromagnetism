I have a banana that seems to have a resistance of 33.7 Î©.
A friend tells me that if you can get the current greater that 2 Amps running through a piece of fruit it sometimes explodes. 
How many car batteries would I need to achieve this? (One car battery is 12 volts).

The variables we know: `R = 33.7` , `I = 2` (this is the minimum we're aiming for)

The variables we don't know: `V = ?`


```
V = I.R
V = 2 x 33.7
V = 67.4
```

We need 67.4 volts to test this ... so if a car battery can provide 12V, we would need 67.4 / 12 = 5.6 batteries.
If I only have access to car batteries, then this means we would need 6 car batteries (assuming I can't have 0.6 of a battery.)
