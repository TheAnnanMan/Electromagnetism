I take a 12.0 volt car battery, and plug it into a banana. I also include an ammeter in the circuit (to measure the current).
The setup looks like this:
![banana in a circuit](http://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/measuring-resistance-of-a-banana-food-physics-paul-ge.jpg)

The ammeter measure 0.356 A (3 s.f.)

So the variables we know are: 
V = 12.0
I = 0.356
R = ? 

Substituting those into the equation we get: 
```
V = I.R
12.0 = 0.356 x R
```

To figure out what R is, we need to rearrange the equation into the form `R = answer`. At the moment there's a 0.356 multiplying with R. 
To nullify the 0.356, we apply the inverse (opposite) of multiplication by 0.356 to both sides of the equation: we divide by 0.356
```
12.0/ 0.356 = (0.356 x R) / 0.356
33.7 = R
```

This banana has a resistance of 33.7 Î©
