To figure out what R is, we need to rearrange the equation into the form `R = answer`. At the moment there's a 0.356 multiplying with R. 
To nullify the 0.356, we apply the inverse (opposite) of multiplication by 0.356 to both sides of the equation: we divide by 0.356
```
12.0/ 0.356 = (0.356 x R) / 0.356
```
