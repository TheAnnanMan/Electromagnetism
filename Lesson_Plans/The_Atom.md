The Atom
========

Key Concepts
------------
- All matter is made up of atoms.
- The atom is very small
- Atoms are composed of three subatomic particles
  - protons
    - +1 charge
    - mass of 1 amu (atomic mass unit)
    - found in nucleus
  - neutrons
    - 0 charge
    - mass of 1 amu (atomic mass unit)
    - found in nucleus
  - electrons
    - -1 charge
    - almost no mass
    - outside the nucleus
- The atom has a heavy nucleus surrounded by much almost massless electrons
- The majority of the mass of the atom is in the nucleus
