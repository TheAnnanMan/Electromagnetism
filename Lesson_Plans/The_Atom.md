The Atom
========

Key Concepts
------------
- All matter is made up of atoms.
- The atom is very small
- Atoms are composed of three subatomic particles; protons, neutrons, electrons
- The atom has a heavy nucleus surrounded by much almost massless electrons
- The nucleus is protons and neutrons
- Protons and neutrons are called nucleons
- Protons have a positive electric charge (+1)
- Electrons have a negative electric charge (-1)
- Neutrons have a neutral electric charge (0)
- The majority of the mass of the atom is in the nucleus
- Each nucleon has an atomic mass unit (amu) of 1
- The mass of the atom is the sum of the nucleons
