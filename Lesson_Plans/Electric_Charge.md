Electric Charge
===============

Key Concepts
------------
- Electrically charged particles experience a force between each other
- There are two kinds of electric charge which we call positive and negative
- Like charges (eg. positive and positive) will exert a force pushing each other away (repulsion)
- Unlike charges (eg. positive and negative) will exert a force pulling the charged particles together (attraction)
